# Hypothesis Test - Lab

## Introduction

In this lab, you'll have the opportunity to decide to pick the variables that you want to perform one and two sample t-tests.

## Objectives

You will be able to:

* Construct and interpret a confidence interval for a single mean
* Perform a hypothesis test for a single mean
* Construct and interpret a confidence interval for two independent means
* Perform a hypothesis test for two independent means


## The Data: Last Words of Death Row Inmates

On Kaggle thre is a famous data set of *[Last Words of Death Row Inmates](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mykhe1097/last-words-of-death-row-inmates)*. While this data set is often used for natural language processing, we'll use the non-text data for statistical inference on one and two means using the t-distribution.

### Data Dictionary

The dataset consists of 545 observations with 21 variables. They are:

* `Execution`: The order of execution, numeric.
* `LastName`: Last name of the offender, character.
* `FirstName`: First name of the offender, character.
* `TDCJNumber`: TDCJ Number of the offender, numeric.
* `Age`: Age of the offender, numeric.
* `Race`: Race of the offender, categorical : Black, Hispanic, White, Other.
* `CountyOfConviction`: County of conviction, character.
* `AgeWhenReceived`: Age of offender when received, numeric.
* `EducationLevel`: Education level of offender, numeric.
* `NativeCounty`: Native county of offender, categorical : 0 = Within Texas, 1= Outside Texas.
* `PreviousCrime`: Whether the offender committed any crime before, categorical: 0= No, 1= Yes.
* `Codefendants`: Number of co-defendants, numeric.
* `NumberVictim`: Number of victims, numeric.
* `WhiteVictim`, `HispanicVictim`, `BlackVictim`, `VictimOtherRace` `FemaleVictim`, `MaleVictim`: Number of victims with specified demographic features, numeric.
* `LastStatement`: Last statement of offender, character.

The [data file](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-hypothesis-testing-ent/blob/main/data/texas.csv) that we'll be using has the first 20 variables, i.e. we're exclusing the `LastStatement` variable.

*N.B.*: Note this data is from 1982 - 2017 and for that time period the data is exhaustive.

## Preliminary Steps

As usual, begin with importing the Python libraries that you will need. Then bring in the data and explore it.

You'll likely want to use `scipy.stats`. If you want to use `confidence_interval(confidence_level=0.95)` with [`scipy.stats.ttest_ind`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html), then you need to have `scipy` version 1.11.0.


```python
# Pip install version 1.11.0 of scipy (if necessary)

# Code here
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__

# Only do this if necessary
! pip install scipy==1.11.0
```

### Preprocessing

While there are a number of preprocessing steps you may choose to make, at the very least you should do the following.

Based on the data dictionary and how the data is interpreted by Numpy, convert any non-numeric data into the proper form. Verify that your code worked correctly.


```python
# Your code here; you may want to use multiple code chunks
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__

# Use the map function to change the two variables
df['NativeCounty'] = df['NativeCounty'].map({1: 'Yes', 0: 'No'})
df['PreviousCrime'] = df['PreviousCrime'].map({1: 'Yes', 0: 'No'})
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__

# Verify this was done correctly
# head
df.head()
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__

# Verify this was done correctly
# info
df.info()
```

### EDA

Now perform Exploratory Data Analysis of at least three variables of your choosing. You should look at both descriptive statistics and visualizations.


```python
# Your code here; you may want to use multiple code chunks
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__

# EDA code sample
# describe

df.describe()
```

## Statistical Inference

### One mean

Now pick a variable that you can perform statistical inference on a single sample mean using the t-distribution.

In the code block below please respond to all of the following (commented out):

*   What is the variable you chose?
*   How do you know it is appropriate for statistical inference on a single mean using the t-distribution?
*   You'll be asked to contruct and interpret a confidence interval. What is the level of confidence that you'll pick?
*   You'll be asked to perform a hypothesis test.
  *   What are the null and alternative hypotheses?
  *   What is the level of significance?




```python
# Type your responses to the bullet points here
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__

# Responses to questions

# Response snippet: Education level with the null value at 0.
```

#### Confidence Interval

Now construct a confidence interval for your chosen variable at the level of confidence you chose above.


```python
# Type your code for the confidence interval here.
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__

# Construct the confidence interval
res1 = stats.ttest_1samp(df.EducationLevel, popmean=0)
res1.confidence_interval(confidence_level=0.95)
```




    ConfidenceInterval(low=9.97464849873312, high=10.390886749308656)



Interpret the confidence interval in the code block below (commented out).


```python
# Interpret the confidence interval
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__

# Interpretation
```

#### Hypothesis Test

Now perform a hypothesis test for your chosen variable at the level of significance you chose above.


```python
# Type your code for the hypothesis test here.
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__

# Perform the hypothesis test

res2 = stats.ttest_1samp(df.EducationLevel, popmean=10)
res2
```




    TtestResult(statistic=1.7266866517489512, pvalue=0.08503239641944645, df=382)



Draw the appropriate conclusion for the hypothesis test and justify your answer in the code block below (commented out).


```python
# Draw the conclusion from the hypothesis test
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__

# Conclusion
```

### Two means

Now pick a variable that you can perform statistical inference on two (independent) sample means using the t-distribution.

In the code block below please respond to all of the following (commented out):

*   What are the variables you chose?
*   How do you know it is appropriate for statistical inference on two (independent)means using the t-distribution?
*   You'll be asked to contruct and interpret a confidence interval. What is the level of confidence that you'll pick?
*   You'll be asked to perform a hypothesis test.
  *   What are the null and alternative hypotheses?
  *   What is the level of significance?


```python
# Type your responses to the bullet points here
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__

# Responses to questions

# Response snippet: Number of victims by previous crime (Yes or No)
```


```python
pc = df[df['PreviousCrime'] == 'Yes']
npc = df[df['PreviousCrime'] == 'No']
```

#### Confidence Interval

Now construct a confidence interval for your chosen variables at the level of confidence you chose above.


```python
# Type your code for the confidence interval here.
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__

# Construct the confidence interval

res3 = stats.ttest_ind(pc.NumberVictim, npc.NumberVictim, equal_var=False, nan_policy='omit')
res3.confidence_interval(confidence_level=0.95)
```




    ConfidenceInterval(low=-0.33541452290014306, high=-0.02988302796441797)



Interpret the confidence interval in the code block below (commented out).


```python
# Interpret the confidence interval
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__

# Interpretation
```

#### Hypothesis Test

Now perform a hypothesis test for your chosen variable at the level of significance you chose above.


```python
# Type your code for the hypothesis test here.
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__

# Perform the hypothesis test

res4 = stats.ttest_ind(pc.NumberVictim, npc.NumberVictim, equal_var=False, nan_policy='omit')
res4
```




    TtestResult(statistic=-2.35164706718915, pvalue=0.019254896396106745, df=343.4147873860235)



Draw the appropriate conclusion for the hypothesis test and justify your answer in the code block below (commented out).


```python
# Draw the conclusion from the hypothesis test
```


```python
# __SOLUTION__

# Conclusion
```

## Summary

Using a multivariate data set, you were able to pick variables to perform one and two sample t confidence intervals and t-tests.
